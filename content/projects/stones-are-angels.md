In our highly networked world, the ethical interferences of the big tech that dominates
our daily lives are opaque. What might we hear if we listen to the ghosts in our
machines? What kind of stories would they have to tell to us?
“Stones are Angels” is a surreptitiously participatory performance that draws
attention to the mineral substratum of our ethereal technologies, by augmenting our
encounter with our electronic companions in situ. Using our intra-actions as means
for collective composition, we speculate on the language of stones, the unity of
spiritual and material life, and our ability to communicate in anthropomorphic ways
with the mineral we.
