KunstUniversität Linz Workshop by Media Artist Chris Ziegler with Master Students from the Department Interface Cultures  and Bruckner University / Dance Department, supported and hosted by REDSAPATA Tanzfabrik.

The workshop takes place in an interactive robotic stage of around 30 motorized LEDs, researching the  relation of human physical motion in a relation to a mechanized environment. How can we make the user or audience experience more physical and participatory? The body of a dancer is connected to the environment and interacts both with the audience and the system. How does moving in a robotic stage transforms the orientation and relation to the human body? What is the experience being Immersed in a mechanical universe?
