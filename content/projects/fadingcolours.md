"FadingColours” is an interactive installation intertwining living algae and almost real-time coral bleaching-data. Creating an ecosystem of tangible data sculptures. Coral reefs are among the most vulnerable ecosystems on the planet. Our world is literally losing colour with the bleaching and disappearance of our coral reefs. Through the technologies that are used to observe, care and research coral reefs, “FadingColours" invites you to enter the coral-algae narrative about our world. In which the digital and the natural blend together. Creating a tangible representation of the algae and corals which gives us the possibility to get to know them. Noor Stenfert Kroese
