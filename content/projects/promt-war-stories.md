The project is developed using various pre-trained text-to-image models, processing text prompt inputs.
On the borderline between sensitive content and an easy slip into topics of violence, this project visualises
the depths of the subconscious of these models, excavating the influences of media and online information
exchange. The quantified traces of reality and collective histories allow algorithms to generate content that
recycles the past - building the spine of quasi-historical narratives - often obfuscated with prejudice and
misinformation, along with the authorâ€™s personal bias. Generated outputs are presented inside a hypertext
object - a tent, that the audience can enter.
