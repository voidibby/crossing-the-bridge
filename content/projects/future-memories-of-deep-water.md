What are the changing conditions for archaeology in underwater ecosystems? Can challenges be predicted and solutions imagined using machine learning? With the passage of time, underwater artifacts are encrusted with coral, algae or other marine organisms. How do human activities and pollutions undermine these natural environments? What will our underwater heritage be like in the future?

The project “Future Memories of Deep Water” explores how algorithms can be used for predicting new entanglements between underwater artifacts and the changing environment where they are discovered. We reflect on current problems and dangers for marine environments, such as “plasticrust” and plastic pollution.

Built upon experimental speculation, “Future Memories of Deep Water” calls for the protection of threatened marine ecosystems and aims to create awareness and encourage preservation of cultural heritage.
