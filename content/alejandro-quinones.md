“Soft Press” will be a sound performance in which modified percussion instruments are automatized by means of live coding and live audio processing. By merging robot-based instruments, programming, and improvisation; “Soft Press aims to generate a sound ecosystem, where sound phenomena are always unexpected and fluctuating. During the performance, a cymbal and a snare drum will react to live coding software (Super Collider) and their sound will be processed to generate an electronic music composition.
